LDGraphy PCBs
=============

Some boot-strapping required ... we need these PCBs first, before we can make
PCBs :)

  * [Laser driver](./laser-drive): fast current source to drive Lasers. Often,
    the Lasers you can buy come with their own driver, but they are very slow.
    This one is meant to switch >= 1Mhz while behaving as a current source.
  * [Beaglebone cape](./cape): work-in-progress: a cape for the
    Beaglebone Black or Green providing all the connections to various
    parts of the set-up.

In the current set-up, they are mounted externally to provide easy access for
measuring various aspects. After the dust settles, they will all fit in the
LDGraphy case.
